I just graduated with my masterâ€™s degree in mechanical engineering and an emphasis in robotics and I'm looking to land my first job! I've spent the last four years as a robotics researcher in the BYU Robotics and Dynamics lab, where I've developed many skills from ROS and Python programming, to hardware and experiment design. My team in the lab focused on human-robot interaction and we recently won two awards: the Best Demo Award at RoboSoft Conference 2024, and the Judge's Choice Award BYU's 2024 Graduate Student Research Fair. Let me know if you want to connect!
