I’ve just received my master’s degree in mechanical engineering with an emphasis in robotics. I am especially interested in using robotics to produce goods and services so that more resources will be available to more people. I've spent the last three years as a robotics research assistant in the BYU Robotics and Dynamics lab, where I've developed many skills from ROS and Python programming, to experiment design and 3D printing design. I'm on a team working in human-robot interaction and in the past three months our project has won two awards.  We received one award at RoboSoft Conference 2024 for best demo in San Diego California, and the other at BYU's 2024 university-wide graduate student research fair for the Judges' Choice Award.
